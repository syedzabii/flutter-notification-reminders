Hi,

We have problem with dependencies especially notifications.

So here is what is important, 

always check pub.dev, they Specify what sdkVersion is required for the package.

for example, flutter_local_notifications: ^19.1.0 requires timezone: ^0.10.0

so we need to add timezone: ^0.10.0 in pubspec.yaml.

also ndkVersion it has been changed to 27.0.12077973 in build.gradle.kts.


we have added, battery optimization helper to check if the app is allowed to run in the background.
it works!

we have launchapp notifications, to redirect to app when notification is clicked.
it works!
